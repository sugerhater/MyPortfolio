# MyPortfolio

This Repository is for the second homework and also future job hunting. It includes 3 html files, a CSS file, and a few images.
Our job is to make as close as provided images as possible. A screenshot for index.html is as shown. The majority code of those HTML files are from bootstrap and bootstrap was the main part of what we learned in week 2 of our boot camp.
